ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the "First Steps and Fundamentals module! This is where your objective of learning C++ begins. 

ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here:

Curated Videos: Kickstart your C++ learning with resources focused on syntax and essential programming skills.
Practical Project Files: Explore and practice real-world applications based on challenges detailed in the 01_Challenges.md file.

ðŸŽ¯ Who Is This For?

These resources are designed for developers interested in learning C++ programming and who already have a basic understanding of general programming concepts, such as loops and foundational Computer Science principles.

ðŸ’¡ What to Expect:

Videos focus on applied learning rather than heavy theoretical exploration.
Content is somewhat beginner-friendly but assumes you have some theoretical Computer Science background as they will not often extensively overview theoretical concepts.
Letâ€™s start building a strong foundation in C++ and set the stage for more advanced modules! ðŸš€
