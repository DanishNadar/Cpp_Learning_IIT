Welcome to the First Steps and Fundamentals folder! ðŸŒŸ This is where your journey into C++ begins.

ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Find Here:

Curated Videos: Kickstart your C++ learning with resources focused on syntax and essential programming skills.
Practical Project Files: Explore and practice real-world applications based on challenges detailed in the 01_Challenges.md file.
ðŸŽ¯ Who Is This For?
These resources are designed for learners who already have a basic understanding of general programming concepts, such as loops and foundational Computer Science principles.

ðŸ’¡ What to Expect:

Videos focus on applied learning rather than heavy theoretical exploration.
Content is beginner-friendly but assumes youâ€™re ready to dive straight into coding!
Letâ€™s start building a strong foundation in C++ and set the stage for more advanced modules! ðŸš€
