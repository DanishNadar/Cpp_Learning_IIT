# Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ module! ðŸŒŸ

This is where you'll learn more about the capabilities of object-oriented programming and learn how to create modular, reusable, and scalable C++ applications.

ðŸ“š **What Youâ€™ll Find Here:**

- **Curated Videos**: Begin your OOP journey with videos that walk you through the essentials of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management.
- **Practical Project Files**: Gain hands-on experience by working through real-world project files based on the challenges outlined in the 02_Challenges.md file.

ðŸŽ¯ **Who Is This For?**

This module is perfect for learners who have already grasped the basics of C++ syntax and are ready to step into the world of object-oriented programming. If you're familiar or confident with basic programming constructs such as loops and conditionals, you're be successful in this module.

ðŸ’¡ **What to Expect:**

- Videos and materials focused on building practical applications, with an emphasis on writing clean and efficient OOP code using C++.
- A hands-on, project-based learning approach that includes everything from defining your first class to managing memory and using inheritance.
- You'll move from basic OOP concepts to more advanced ones, helping you build robust C++ applications ready for real-world use.
